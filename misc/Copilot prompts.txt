Hi, copilot, I have a question. I have attached an image taken by USB microscope. As you can see, in the lower right side, there is a serial marking of the device. It is a number. 

Normally, engineers will list this serial number "manually" and put it in list using Excel file. This takes time of engineer. So it is something that I want to automate using image processing. Here are my questions:

1. Can you correctly identify the serial numbers of the 6 units in the image? Please provide me your readings so I can check.
2. How can I do it using Python? I am thinking image processing or OCR but you can give me your best suggestions.
3. What are the factors to consider to have higher accuracy for this automation?

Thanks


------------------------------------------------------

What are the python package that I need to install?
1. pip install opencv-python (need vswhere so install VS Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/, select C++ build tools)
2. pip install pytesseract
3. sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
3.1 You also need to install the Tesseract engine itself: Windows: Download from Tesseract GitHub
4. pip install numpy 
5. pip install pandas
6. pip install openpyxl
7. pip install scikit-image
8. pip install pillow

---------------------------------------------------

I want to start simpler first. For the image above, I want to recreate how to extract its serial numbers. Can you give me the python package that I need and python code to start with. Thanks


pip install opencv-python
pip install pytesseract
pip install pillow

Important:
You also need to install Tesseract OCR engine on your system:

import cv2
import pytesseract

# Path to your image
image_path = "WIN_20251024_10_12_08_Pro.jpg"

# Load image
img = cv2.imread(image_path)

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply threshold to improve contrast
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 150, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Configure Tesseract for digits only
custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6 -c tessedit_char_whitelist=0123456789'

# Extract text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, config=custom_config)

print("Detected text:", text)
